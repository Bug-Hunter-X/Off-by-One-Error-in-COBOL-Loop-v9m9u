This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in COBOL loops. The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version.  The error stems from an incorrect loop termination condition, leading to an inaccurate count. The solution highlights the importance of carefully considering loop boundaries in COBOL programming.
